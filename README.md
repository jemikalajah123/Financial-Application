# Financial-Application
Investment Calculator Application is an application that enables a user to know the future value of an investment for a given period. 
This application  can also be used and built into a full investment and savings application.

This Application folder contains two similar applications but with different architecture.
    -Application-PHP
        This applicationn is built with html,css, vanilla javascript, ajax and jquery and php. I used it to test the integration of my backend skills to my frontend skills, send request and call scripts.
        This application only returns the exepected future earning of the user. This kind of architecture is not recommended for production.
    -Application-Javascript (Full Frontend Application)
        This is the same application built as a full frontend project with all errors handling and validation done with javascript unlike the other above where it was done with php. It takes into consideration of inflation and tax rate while calculating the using Future earnings. It returns three different values of earning depending on the interest rate, inflation rate and tax rate.
